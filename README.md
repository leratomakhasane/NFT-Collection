What is a Non-Fungible Token? 
Fungible means to be the same or interchangeable eg Eth is fungible. 
With this in mind, NFTs are unique; each one is different. 
Every single token has unique characteristics and values. 
They are all distinguishable from one another and are not interchangeable.

What is ERC-721? 
ERC-721 is an open standard that describes how to build Non-Fungible tokens on EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible blockchains; 
it is a standard interface for Non-Fungible tokens; it has a set of rules which make it easy to work with NFTs.
